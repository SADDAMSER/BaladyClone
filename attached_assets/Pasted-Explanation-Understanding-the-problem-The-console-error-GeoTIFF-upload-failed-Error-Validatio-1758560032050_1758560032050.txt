Explanation

Understanding the problem
The console error "GeoTIFF upload failed: Error: Validation failed" indicates that there was an issue while trying to upload a GeoTIFF file. The specific reason for the failure is a "Validation failed" error, meaning the data within the GeoTIFF file did not meet the expected format or criteria required by the GeographicDataManager. This could be due to various reasons such as incorrect metadata, unsupported projection, or invalid internal structure of the GeoTIFF.

How to verify
To verify that this error is specifically related to the content or format of the GeoTIFF file, try uploading a different GeoTIFF file that is known to be valid and compatible with the application. If the error does not appear with a different file, it confirms that the issue lies within the problematic GeoTIFF. You could also try using a GeoTIFF validator tool online to check the file's integrity and structure.

Suggested fix
The fix involves ensuring the GeoTIFF file being uploaded conforms to the expected format and validation rules of the GeographicDataManager.

Here are some steps you can take:

Check GeoTIFF specifications: Consult the documentation or requirements for the GeographicDataManager or the application you are using to understand what specific GeoTIFF formats, projections, and metadata are supported and required.
Examine the problematic GeoTIFF: Use a GeoTIFF viewer or a geospatial software (like QGIS or ArcGIS) to inspect the GeoTIFF file that is causing the error. Look for any unusual metadata, unsupported projections, or corrupted data.
Convert or re-export the GeoTIFF: If the GeoTIFF file does not meet the required specifications, you may need to convert it to a supported format or re-export it from its source software with the correct settings. Ensure the correct projection and any necessary metadata are included.
Update the GeographicDataManager (if applicable): If you have control over the GeographicDataManager code, review the validation logic within the mutationFn function in GeographicDataManager.tsx (around line 229) to understand what specific checks are being performed. You might need to adjust the validation rules or handle certain edge cases if the GeoTIFF file is technically valid but triggering a false validation error.
Since the error originates from GeographicDataManager.tsx and involves a mutationFn, the code snippet provided is likely not the direct cause of the validation failure, but rather part of a console logging or error handling mechanism. The issue is most likely with the data being processed by the GeographicDataManager.

Summary
The "GeoTIFF upload failed: Error: Validation failed" error indicates that the GeoTIFF file you attempted to upload did not pass the validation checks performed by the GeographicDataManager. To fix this, ensure your GeoTIFF file meets the required format, projection, and metadata specifications. You may need to inspect, convert, or re-export the file.
