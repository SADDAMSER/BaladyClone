Understanding the problem
This error message indicates that your server encountered an unexpected condition and was unable to fulfill the request. The 500 Internal Server Error is a generic server-side error, meaning the problem is not with the request sent by the browser but with something on the server's end. While the initial request resulted in a 301 Moved Permanently redirect, the subsequent request to the new location /api/applications/assign resulted in the 500 error. The traceback shows the error originating from a GET request to /api/applications/assign.

How to verify
Check server logs: The most effective way to understand the specific issue is to examine the server-side logs for the application running at https://a4619ae2-2438-4e06-9d1e-598af6ed1654-00-3u0a0b7iug7pu.worf.replit.dev. Look for error messages or stack traces corresponding to the timestamp of the failed request.
Inspect the network request details: In the Network tab of Chrome DevTools, click on the failing GET request to /api/applications/assign. Examine the "Response" tab for any additional details the server might have sent about the error.
Reproduce the request: If possible, try to reproduce the request using tools like curl or Postman to see if the error persists and to get a cleaner view of the response.
Suggested fix
The fix requires investigating the server-side code and environment. Based on the generic nature of the error, here are common areas to check:

Server-side code errors: Review the code that handles the GET request to /api/applications/assign. Look for unhandled exceptions, logic errors, or issues with database interactions, file system access, or external API calls.
Server configuration issues: Check the server configuration (e.g., web server settings, application server settings) for any misconfigurations that might be causing the error.
Resource limitations: The server might be running into resource limitations (e.g., memory, CPU, disk space) that are preventing it from processing the request.
External dependencies: If the server relies on external services or databases, ensure they are accessible and functioning correctly.
Since the error is a GET request, the server is likely trying to retrieve data or perform an action that is failing. Focus your investigation on the server-side logic for the /api/applications/assign endpoint.

Summary
A 500 Internal Server Error indicates a problem on the server side. To fix it, you need to investigate the server's logs and code to identify the specific cause of the error when handling the GET request to /api/applications/assign.
