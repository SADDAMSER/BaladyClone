Explanation

Understanding the problem
The console error POST https://.../auto-assign 500 (Internal Server Error) indicates that the server encountered an unexpected issue while processing the POST request from your client. A 500 Internal Server Error is a generic error code that means the server cannot fulfill the request due to a problem on the server side.

How to verify
To confirm that the issue is on the server side, you can try sending the same POST request using a tool like Postman or curl. If you receive a 500 error with those tools as well, it strongly suggests the problem lies within the server's code or configuration [2].

Additionally, checking the server logs is the most effective way to understand the specific error that occurred on the server. The logs will contain detailed information about the cause of the 500 error [2].

Suggested fix
Since the error is server-side, the fix needs to be implemented on the server. Common causes for 500 errors on POST requests with a JSON body include:

Incorrectly formatted JSON data: The server might be failing to parse the JSON sent in the request body [1]. Ensure the JSON being sent is valid and matches the expected structure on the server.
Server-side code errors: There might be a bug in the server-side code that handles the /api/applications/:id/auto-assign endpoint. This could be anything from a database error to a logical error in processing the request [2].
Missing or incorrect headers: Although less common for a 500 error specifically, sometimes incorrect headers like Content-Type can cause issues [3]. In this case, the Content-Type: application/json header is present and correct for sending JSON, so this is less likely the cause.
Resource limitations: The server might be running out of memory, CPU, or other resources when trying to process the request.
The most effective way to fix this is to:

Examine the server logs: Identify the specific error message and stack trace in the server logs. This will pinpoint the exact location and nature of the problem.
Debug the server-side code: Based on the server logs, step through the code on the server that handles the /api/applications/:id/auto-assign endpoint to understand why it's failing.
Without access to the server-side code and logs, it's impossible to provide a specific code fix.

Summary
The 500 Internal Server Error for the POST request indicates a problem on the server while processing the request. To fix this, you need to investigate the server logs to identify the specific error and then debug the server-side code handling the /api/applications/:id/auto-assign endpoint.
